== Paragraphs

=== Example 1. Paragraph

Paragraphs don't require special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is defined by one or more consecutive lines of text.
Line breaks within a paragraph are not displayed.

Leave at least one empty line to begin a new paragraph.

=== Example 2. Literal paragraph
A normal paragraph.

 A literal paragraph.
 One or more consecutive lines indented by at least one space.

 The text is shown in a fixed-width (typically monospace) font.
 The lines are preformatted (i.e., as formatted in the source).
 Spaces and newlines,
 like the ones in this sentence,
 are preserved.

=== [[example-3]] Example 3. Hard line breaks
Roses are red, +
violets are blue.

[%hardbreaks]
A ruby is red.
Java is black.

=== Example 4. Lead paragraph
[.lead]
This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).

This paragraph will not be.

== Text formatting

=== [[example-5]] Example 5. Constrained bold, italic, and monospace
It has *strong* significance to me.

I _cannot_ stress this enough.

Type `OK` to accept.

That *_really_* has to go.

Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

=== Example 6. Unconstrained bold, italic, and monospace

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD)

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!

It was Beatle**__mania__**!

=== Example 7. Highlight, underline, strikethrough, and custom role

Mark my words, #automation is essential#.

##Mark##up refers to text that contains formatting ##mark##s.

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

We need [.line-through]#ten# twenty VMs.

A [.myrole]#custom role# must be fulfilled by the theme.

=== Example 8. Superscript and subscript
^super^script phrase

~sub~script phrase

=== Example 9. Smart quotes and apostrophes
"`double curved quotes`"

'`single curved quotes`'

Olaf's desk was a mess.

A ``std::vector```'s size is the number of items it contains.
